Suppose you are designing a music player application. The music player has multiple subsystems, 
such as the audio player, the playlist manager, and the user interface. You want to use the Facade pattern to 
simplify the interaction between the client and the subsystems.

Design a Facade class for the music player application that provides a simple interface for 
the client to perform the following tasks:

Play a song
Pause a song
Add a song to the playlist
Remove a song from the playlist
Display the current playlist
